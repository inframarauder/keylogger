# keylogger

A key stroke reading application made using node.js. The .exe file was generated using a node module called 'nexe'.
The application secretly records keystrokes and stores them in a file 'log.txt'.

Can be embedded to work with any desktop application by making changes to launch.bat.
The application's target file should then be changed to the .bat file to run the keylogger in background.

Please note:
This is just an experimental project and I DO NOT SUPPORT MALICIOUS USE OF THIS APPLICATION. YOU SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY MISUSE OF THIS PROJECT.
